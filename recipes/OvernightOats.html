    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Overnight oats are a healthy raw breakfast recipe that consists of soaking rolled oats in milk overnight in the fridge.

        It has a similar texture to oatmeal, except itâ€™s uncooked and preserves all the nutrients and healthy properties of the ingredients as no heat is involved.
    </p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1.5 cup Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons Chia Seeds </li>
        <li> 2 scoops Protein Powder </li>
        <li> 2 cups Almond Milk </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons Maple Syrup </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon Cinnamon </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add old-fashioned rolled oats, chia seeds, protein powder, and cinnamon. Stir to distribute evenly.</li>
        <li>Stir in almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Seal the bowl with a lid, refrigerate overnight. I recommend stirring the mixture 1 hour after you pop it in the fridge. This prevents the chia seeds from sinking to the bottom of the bowl.</li>
        <li>The next day, serve in small serving jars with peanut butter, dairy-free yogurt, fresh berries, and nuts.</li>
    </ol>
